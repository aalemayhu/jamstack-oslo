# Practicalities

Sanity.io is located in Grünerløkka not far from downtown Oslo. You can easily
get there by trams 11 / 12 / 13. If you arrive by tram the stop is Olaf Ryes
plass from where you have a few minutes walk to the Sanity entrance. The
entrance is right next to Godt brød and very visible. Look for a yellow
building or use Google Maps: https://goo.gl/maps/BuuYvnW4AnF2.

If you have any issues reaching the venue or questions, feel free to call
Alexander on +47 401 04 387.

See you soon!
